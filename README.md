# globalSetup is executed with wrong CWD

When using `vitest.workspace.ts` file in a monorepo, the `globalSetup` script is
executed with the CWD set to the monorepo root rather than the package root.

The `vite.config.ts` is correctly executed with the package root as CWD.

Logs from the "Output" of the "Vitest" extension:

```log
